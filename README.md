# ⏰ Alarm Clock with Python & Tkinter

A simple alarm clock application created using Python with Tkinter library in a Jupyter Notebook. This beginner-friendly project features a graphical user interface for setting alarms and plays a soft alert sound when the alarm time is reached.



# 📁 Files Included

•	AlarmClock Project.ipynb – Main Jupyter Notebook containing the Python code for the alarm clock with GUI.

•	morning_flower.wav – Alarm sound file that plays when the set time is triggered.



# 📌 Features

🕰️ Set one-time alarms through a graphical user interface

🔔 Audible alert when the alarm time is reached

📅 Real-time clock display

🧠 Hands-on experience with Python modules like datetime, time, and playsound

📊 Basic time pattern analysis using alarm logs (optional extension)



# 🛠️ Technologies Used

•	Python 3.x

•	Tkinter – for the graphical user interface

•	datetime & time – for managing and comparing alarm times

•	playsound – for alarm audio playback (can be replaced with other audio libraries)

•	Jupyter Notebook – for interactive development and documentation
